                    I love to code! I really enjoy the problem solving and analytical aspects in programming. I work in the field, having two years
                    experience coding in JavaScript. I have used such technolgies as D3.js, Node.js, and PptxGenJS. I have some experience with
                    ExtJS and Express.

                    Some of my hobbies are exercising, hikings, and photography. My passions include writing and reading, as well as cooking anything
                    Italian. I love to toss some pizza dough or roll out some pasta dough. There is nothing I love more than fresh pesto!

                    I hope you enjoy looking through some of my work.
